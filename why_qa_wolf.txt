As a creative person, I believe the devil is in the details. It’s incredibly satisfying nailing the minutia of a project that ultimately contributes towards a greater experience for all involved.

Working at QA Wolf seems like too good of an opportunity to miss, as I believe I’ll be able to exponentially grow my skill set by being exposed to, and writing tests for a wealth of pre-existing code bases. 
I strive to be the best version of myself as I can be and I’m always eager to improve so it’s great to know there are opportunities to move up and be promoted.

There are also many other areas of Software Engineering, beyond just pure development, that have been of interest to me for a while such as QA and managing CI/CD pipelines.
A QA Engineer position at QA Wolf would enable glimpses into those interests while providing invaluable experience. 	

Finally, I can also be scrappy when it calls for it. 
I think this is best exhibited by my career switch, as I was willing to bet on myself and step away from what was safe and comfortable in order to pursue a field I’ve had a long standing interest in and I’ve no intention of stopping until it works.
